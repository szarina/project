<h1>How can you help the victim</h1>
<h2>Listen:</h2>
<p>If possible, find a time and place that is safe and confidential to talk to your friend/family member. Start the conversation by expressing concern, i.e
  . “I am worried about your safety.”
   Allow your friend/family to
   speak and let them know
    you believe what they are telling you.</p>
<h2>Offer support:</h2>
<img src="he.jfif" alt="j">
<p>Let them know they are not alone and that
   no one deserves to be hurt. Abuse
    is not the victim’s fault. Assure
     them what they are feeling is okay.
      Then, ask how you can best support them.</p>
<h2>Respect their choices: </h2>
<p>Do not pressure
   them into leaving. It
    is never as simple as just leaving. There are many
    reasons people stay in an abusive relationship
    . Offer them support and resources, but ultimately
     know it is their decision. Do not be judgmental or make them feel bad for staying
      in an abusive relationship. Let them know you will be there for them no matter
      what choice they make.</p>
<h2>Help safety plan</h2>
